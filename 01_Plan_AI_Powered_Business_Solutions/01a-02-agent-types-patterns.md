### Four Agent Types Explained

#### 1. **Task Agent** 📝
- **Purpose:** Executes a single, well-defined action in response to a user request or workflow trigger.
- **Typical Actions:** Sending emails, updating CRM records, processing files, making API calls.
- **Complexity:** Low—logic is straightforward, usually mapped 1:1 to a business operation.
- **Strengths:** Fast, reliable, easy to test and debug. Minimal context required.
- **Limitations:** Not suitable for tasks requiring planning, adaptation, or multiple steps.
- **Example:**  
  ```
  User: "Send a follow-up email to this customer"
  Agent: Composes and sends the email using provided details.
  ```
- **When to Use:** When a single, atomic action is needed and requirements are clear.

#### 2. **Autonomous Agent** 🔄
- **Purpose:** Manages complex, multi-step workflows independently, often making decisions at each stage.
- **Capabilities:** Plans, executes, and adapts across several steps; can invoke other agents or tools.
- **Complexity:** High—handles branching logic, error handling, and business rules.
- **Strengths:** Reduces manual intervention, supports end-to-end automation, adapts to changing context.
- **Limitations:** Harder to debug, requires robust monitoring and error handling.
- **Example:**  
  ```
  Agent: Receives a new sales lead → Qualifies lead → Enriches with company data → Assigns to sales rep → Schedules follow-up.
  ```
- **When to Use:** For workflows with 4+ steps, complex business logic, or when autonomous decision-making is required.

#### 3. **Prompt Agent** 💡
- **Purpose:** Preprocesses and enriches user input before main agent or workflow execution.
- **Capabilities:** Adds context, reformulates queries, injects business-specific information.
- **Complexity:** Low to medium—may use templates, context retrieval, or lightweight reasoning.
- **Strengths:** Improves accuracy and relevance of downstream processing, supports personalization.
- **Limitations:** Limited to input enhancement; does not perform main task.
- **Example:**  
  ```
  User: "Find recent invoices"
  Prompt Agent: Adds company context, reformulates as "Find invoices from last 30 days for Acme Corp."
  ```
- **When to Use:** When input needs enrichment, normalization, or context injection before processing.

#### 4. **Response Agent** 📤
- **Purpose:** Transforms, formats, or post-processes outputs from main agent or workflow.
- **Capabilities:** Converts results to required formats (JSON, PDF), summarizes, or applies business rules to output.
- **Complexity:** Low to medium—may involve formatting, validation, or minor logic.
- **Strengths:** Ensures outputs meet integration, reporting, or compliance requirements.
- **Limitations:** Does not affect core processing; only modifies final output.
- **Example:**  
  ```
  Main Agent: Generates analysis report.
  Response Agent: Converts report to PDF and emails to stakeholders.
  ```
- **When to Use:** When output needs formatting, transformation, or distribution after main processing.

- Each code issue is different and may require unique troubleshooting steps
- Agent understands context, error messages, and code structure
- Provides interactive debugging, step-by-step explanations, and alternative solutions
- Can answer follow-up questions, refactor code, and teach best practices
- Supports conversational problem-solving, making it ideal for learning and support

#### 4. **Personal Productivity Assistant**
```
User: "Help me organize my tasks for the week"
Agent: Gathers user goals → Prioritizes tasks → Suggests schedule → Adjusts based on feedback
```
**Why Single Agent:**
- Task organization is highly personalized and context-dependent
- Agent adapts recommendations as user priorities or constraints change
- Supports ongoing dialog, reminders, and dynamic re-planning
- No rigid workflow—agent flexibly manages evolving requirements

#### 5. **Troubleshooting Advisor**
```
User: "Why is my application running slowly?"
Agent: Asks clarifying questions → Analyzes logs → Suggests optimizations → Guides through fixes
```
**Why Single Agent:**
- Troubleshooting requires adaptive questioning and analysis
- Agent tailors investigation based on user input and discovered symptoms
- Can pivot strategies, escalate to deeper diagnostics, and explain solutions
- Handles open-ended, exploratory problem-solving without a fixed process

### Pattern 1: Sequential Orchestration

**Definition:** Agents execute in a strict, predefined order, with each agent's output serving as the input for the next. This pattern enforces dependencies between steps, ensuring that each stage is completed before the next begins.

**When to Use:**
- Step-by-step workflows where each stage relies on the previous output
- Processes requiring validation or transformation at each step
- Scenarios needing deterministic, auditable execution order
- Compliance-driven tasks with clear checkpoints

**Example: Content Creation Pipeline**
```
Step 1: Research Agent gathers information from trusted sources
  ↓ (passes research data)
Step 2: Writing Agent drafts content based on research findings
  ↓ (passes draft)
Step 3: Review Agent edits, checks for accuracy, and approves final version
  ↓ (optional: passes to Publishing Agent)
Step 4: Publishing Agent distributes content to target channels
```

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use explicit handoff between agents to maintain traceability
- Log outputs at each stage for audit and debugging
- Apply validation checks before moving to the next step
- Consider error handling and rollback mechanisms for reliability

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ Predictable, repeatable flow with clear accountability
- ✅ Easy to debug and audit due to stepwise progression
- ✅ Supports compliance and documentation requirements
- ❌ Slower overall execution (no parallelism)
- ❌ Bottlenecks possible if one step is delayed

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Document processing and approval workflows
- Data transformation pipelines
- Multi-stage content creation and publishing
- Regulatory compliance checks
- Onboarding or multi-step form processing


### Pattern 2: Concurrent Orchestration

**Definition:** Multiple agents process same task independently, results aggregated.

**When to Use:**
- Need multiple perspectives
- Independent analysis required
- Ensemble decision-making
- Time-sensitive processing

**Example: Risk Assessment**
```
Credit Risk Agent ─┐
Market Risk Agent ─┼→ Risk Aggregator → Final Risk Score
Legal Risk Agent  ─┘
```

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ Faster processing (parallel)
- ✅ Higher accuracy (consensus)  
- ✅ Redundancy (failure tolerance)
- ❌ More expensive (multiple LLM calls)

### Pattern 3: Group Chat Orchestration

**Definition:** Agents collaborate iteratively, manager controls speaker order.

**When to Use:**
- Iterative refinement needed
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Multiple rounds of review
- Creative/brainstorming tasks

**Example: Strategic Planning**
```
Moderator Agent (coordinates discussion)
  ↓ selects speaker
Market Analyst Agent → Market insights
  ↓ moderator selects next
Financial Analyst Agent → Financial implications  
  ↓ moderator selects next
Strategy Agent → Strategic recommendations (refined)
```

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ High-quality outputs
- ✅ Iterative improvement
- ✅ Diverse perspectives
- ❌ Can be slow (multiple rounds)

### Pattern 4: Handoff Orchestration

**Definition:** Agents transfer control dynamically based on context.

**When to Use:**
- Specialized expertise needed
- Dynamic routing required
- Escalation scenarios
- Multi-department workflows

**Example: IT Support**
```
Triage Agent (analyzes issue type)
  ↓ hands off to appropriate specialist
Network Agent OR Security Agent OR Application Agent
  ↓ escalates if needed
L2 Support Agent
```

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ Right expert handles task
- ✅ Scalable (add more specialists)
- ✅ Flexible routing logic
- ❌ Complex orchestration logic

### Pattern 5: Magentic Orchestration

**Definition:** A Magentic orchestration is a complex, generalist multi-agent system inspired by Microsoft Research's MagenticOne. In this pattern, an orchestrator agent coordinates a diverse set of specialized agents—such as web search, code analysis, data extraction, and synthesis agents—to tackle open-ended, multi-modal tasks. Agents operate both independently and collaboratively, sharing context and results to build a comprehensive solution. This approach enables autonomous research, deep analysis, and integration of information from multiple sources and modalities.

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Competitive market analysis combining web data, financial reports, and technical documentation.
- End-to-end research projects requiring synthesis of information from diverse sources.
- Automated due diligence or compliance checks involving multiple data types.
- Multi-modal investigations (e.g., combining text, code, and images).

**When to Use:**
- Research tasks
- Complex problem-solving  
- Need web search + code + file analysis
- Open-ended exploration

**Example: Competitive Analysis**
```
Orchestrator Agent
  ├→ Web Search Agent (finds competitor info)
  ├→ Financial Analyst Agent (analyzes reports)
  ├→ Code Analyst Agent (reviews technical capabilities)
  └→ Synthesizer Agent (creates comprehensive analysis)
```

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ Handles complex tasks
- ✅ Autonomous problem-solving
- ✅ Comprehensive analysis
- ❌ Most expensive pattern
- ❌ Longest execution time
